The sun was shining on the sea,<br>
Shining with all his might:<br>
He did his very best to make<br>
The billows smooth and bright--<br>
And this was odd, because it was<br>
The middle of the night.<br>

</font></p><p><font size="+1">

The moon was shining sulkily,<br>
Because she thought the sun<br>
Had got no business to be there<br>
After the day was done--<br>
"It's very rude of him," she said,<br>
"To come and spoil the fun!"<br>

</font></p><p><font size="+1">

The sea was wet as wet could be,<br>
The sands were dry as dry.<br>
You could not see a cloud, because<br>
No cloud was in the sky:<br>
No birds were flying overhead--<br>
There were no birds to fly.<br>

</font></p><p><font size="+1">

The Walrus and the Carpenter<br>
Were walking close at hand;<br>
They wept like anything to see<br>
Such quantities of sand:<br>
"If this were only cleared away,"<br>
They said, "it would be grand!"<br>

</font></p><p><font size="+1">

"If seven maids with seven mops<br>
Swept it for half a year.<br>
Do you suppose," the Walrus said,<br>
"That they could get it clear?"<br>
"I doubt it," said the Carpenter,<br>
And shed a bitter tear.<br>

</font></p><p><font size="+1">

"O Oysters, come and walk with us!"<br>
The Walrus did beseech.<br>
"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,<br>
Along the briny beach:<br>
We cannot do with more than four,<br>
To give a hand to each."<br>

</font></p><p><font size="+1">

The eldest Oyster looked at him,<br>
But never a word he said:<br>
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,<br>
And shook his heavy head--<br>
Meaning to say he did not choose<br>
To leave the oyster-bed.<br>

</font></p><p><font size="+1">

But four young Oysters hurried up,<br>
All eager for the treat:<br>
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,<br>
Their shoes were clean and neat--<br>
And this was odd, because, you know,<br>
They hadn't any feet.<br>

</font></p><p><font size="+1">

Four other Oysters followed them,<br>
And yet another four;<br>
And thick and fast they came at last,<br>
And more, and more, and more--<br>
All hopping through the frothy waves,<br>
And scrambling to the shore.<br>

</font></p><p><font size="+1">

The Walrus and the Carpenter<br>
Walked on a mile or so,<br>
And then they rested on a rock<br>
Conveniently low:<br>
And all the little Oysters stood<br>
And waited in a row.<br>

</font></p><p><font size="+1">

"The time has come," the Walrus said,<br>
"To talk of many things:<br>
Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--<br>
Of cabbages--and kings--<br>
And why the sea is boiling hot--<br>
And whether pigs have wings."<br>

</font></p><p><font size="+1">

"But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,<br>
"Before we have our chat;<br>
For some of us are out of breath,<br>
And all of us are fat!"<br>
"No hurry!" said the Carpenter.<br>
They thanked him much for that.<br>

</font></p><p><font size="+1">

"A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,<br>
"Is what we chiefly need:<br>
Pepper and vinegar besides<br>
Are very good indeed--<br>
Now if you're ready, Oysters dear,<br>
We can begin to feed."<br>

</font></p><p><font size="+1">

"But not on us!" the Oysters cried,<br>
Turning a little blue.<br>
"After such kindness, that would be<br>
A dismal thing to do!"<br>
"The night is fine," the Walrus said.<br>
"Do you admire the view?<br>

</font></p><p><font size="+1">

"It was so kind of you to come!<br>
And you are very nice!"<br>
The Carpenter said nothing but<br>
"Cut us another slice:<br>
I wish you were not quite so deaf--<br>
I've had to ask you twice!"<br>

</font></p><p><font size="+1">

"It seems a shame," the Walrus said,<br>
"To play them such a trick,<br>
After we've brought them out so far,<br>
And made them trot so quick!"<br>
The Carpenter said nothing but<br>
"The butter's spread too thick!"<br>

</font></p><p><font size="+1">

"I weep for you," the Walrus said:<br>
"I deeply sympathize."<br>
With sobs and tears he sorted out<br>
Those of the largest size,<br>
Holding his pocket-handkerchief<br>
Before his streaming eyes.<br>

</font></p><p><font size="+1">

"O Oysters," said the Carpenter,<br>
"You've had a pleasant run!<br>
Shall we be trotting home again?'<br>
But answer came there none--<br>
And this was scarcely odd, because<br>
They'd eaten every one.<br>
